# Crypto-Automation
This project analyzes crypto chart patterns and automatically places buy and sell orders to maximize profit. 


In order to use this project efficiently, place your login information to RobinHood in the login.txt file, and then run the selltest.py program to determine which index corresponds to which cryptocurrency. Currently, the only supported cryptocurrencies are BTC, ETH, and LTC. As of right now, the user must find the index on their own, as when building the robinhood portfolio, each user bought different cryptos in different order. **Fix will come soon**
